# Contributing to the Course

Hey, thanks for contributing!

## How Can I Contribute?

Content presentation is controlled by the config file `course-structure.json`. All content is in the `content` directory sorted by the slug in `course-structure.json`. Static assets are in the `assets` directory.

### Adding Content

If you'd like to add content, please start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course/issues/new) and tagging `@jamesrp13` to discuss your reasoning, plan, and timeline.

Once a plan has been discussed and agreed to, you can start working on content. 

When you're done, create a PR for the `main`` branch.

Create new modules in the same format as the existing modules - see [Getting Started](./content/getting-started.md).

This structure leans into a pedagogical technique called **IWY loops****. IWY stands for "I do, We do, You do." Each step along the way increases the audience's exposure to the topic _and_ reduces the amount of handholding you're given.

### Editing Existing Content

If you want to fix a typo or otherwise improve on existing content, follow a similar process as with adding content:

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course/issues/new) and/or comment on an existing issue to state you've started working
2. Create a PR to the `draft` branch during or when complete

### Guidelines

The guidelines below are consistent with Solana Foundation Style, to ensure consistency with other content on solana.com. There are also a few additional items aimed at technical documents. 

Use language consistent with [TERMINOLOGY](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/blob/main/docs/terminology.md) and (if you have access to this) the Solana Foundation Style Guide. 

In particular:

- Use sentence case for headlines (”Solana Foundation announces new initiative” instead of “Solana Foundation Announces New Initiative”).
- Use 'secret key' rather than 'private key' to be consistent with web3.js. __Note__: this will change in a future version of web3.js. 
- Use 'wallet app' for software. 'wallet' for the address that holds value.
- Use 'onchain' (not on-chain, definitely not smart contract) when referring to onchain apps. This comes from the Solana Foundation style guide, and is intended to be similar to 'online'. 
- Use 'SOL' rather than 'Sol' to refer to Solana's native token. Definitely don't call it Solana!
- PDAs are not public keys. It is not possible to have a public key without a secret key. A public key is derived from a secret key, and it is not possible to generate a public key without first generating a secret key.
- Use the terms 'blockchain' or 'web3' rather than 'crypto'.
- Be careful about the term 'token account'. A ['token account' is any account formatted to hold tokens](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/7507/what-is-the-difference-between-a-token-account-and-an-associated-token-account), and being specific (rather than, for example, swapping between 'associated token account' and 'token account') makes this clearer. 
  - Use the specific term 'associated token account' rather than just 'token account' if you're referring to an account at an associated token address.  
  - Use 'token mint account' to refer to the address where a token is minted. E.g., the [USDC mainnet token mint account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v).
Use apostrophes of possession, [including for inanimate objects](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1031/is-using-the-possessive-s-correct-in-the-cars-antenna). Eg 'the account's balance' is correct.
- Don't use 'here' links. They make the course hard to scan and ['here' links are bad for SEO](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/links-should-never-say-click-here/).
- JS/TS clients send `transactions` made from `instructions`. Onchain programs have `instruction handlers` that process `instructions`. Do not refer to [instruction handlers](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#instruction-handler) as instructions! The reason is simple: an instruction cannot process an instruction. The `multiple` template in Anchor 0.29 also calls the actual functions `handler`.

Code examples should be formatted as follows:

### Code

You're writing code to be read, understood, and changed by others.

We want the minimal amount of code necessary to solve the problem.
 
 - Use full names. Call a `thing` a `thing`. Don't call it a `thg`. Avoid repetitive, copy-paste code. This helps others change the code easily, as they can fix things in a single place.
 - Avoid magic numbers. Nobody should see a `+ 32` in your code and wonder what the `32` means.
 - Avoid asking students to clone a git repo. The idea is that students should be able to create projects from scratch when they have finished the course. Referring to the code students have made in previous chapters is fine. 
  - `esrun` means you don't need to set up `tsconfig.json` files just to run TypeScript code. 
  - Tools like `anchor init` or `create-solana-dapp` are fine. 
  - If there's some boilerplate, Solana-specific code you always need [make a PR to the helpers repository](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers).

### JS/TS

We're trying to focus on Solana, not teaching JS/TS development and setup. This means reducing the JS/TS concepts needed to understand our demo code.

 - `ts` files are run with `esrun`, which supports top-level `await`, doesn't require a `tsconfig.json`, etc. There is no need for `async function main()` wrappers or [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). `await` just works. If you see these wrappers, delete them.

 - Likewise, use async/await and use try / catch all the time, rather than sometimes using `.then()` and `.catch()`

 - Throw errors with `throw new Error('message')`. Don't throw strings (JS allows almost any type to be thrown). TS code can assume anything thrown is of the `Error` type. 

 - Don't make custom helper functions. Instead, use the `@solana-developers/helpers` package. If you need a function that doesn't exist, make a PR to `@solana-developers/helpers`, and add the helper, tests, and docs.

 - Use two spaces per prettier defaults, StandardJS, node style guide, idiomatic JS, AirBnB style guide, MDN, Google Style guide, codepen, jsfiddle, etc.

 - Write tests so we can run your code and ensure a new release of something doesn't break your code. Ensure your tests make sense. BDD style (which Anchor uses by default) uses `describe` and `it` to create the names. So `describe('the plus operator', () => {}` becomes `describe the plus operation` and `it('adds numbers', () => {...})` becomes `it adds numbers`.  Ensure your test names make sense!

### Rust & Anchor

 - Avoid magic numbers. People reading your code should be able to understand where values come from. Use [InitSpace](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.InitSpace.html) to calculate space needed for accounts, and add a constant `DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE` to `constants.rs`.

  - Bad: `8 + 32 + 32 + 8 + 8`

  - Good: `space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + SomeAccount::INIT_SPACE,` 

 - Use four spaces per `rustfmt`.

 - Use the [multiple files template](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/release-notes#multiple-files-template) to organize very large Anchor projects. 

##  Diagrams:

- If you draw Solana elliptic curves, these are [Edwards curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_curve)
- Use [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) for diagrams
- Use SVG where possible (they'll look better on different screens). You can get an SVG export from Whimsical by appending `/svg` to the end of a Whimsical URL.
 
Note that while `prettier` can format Markdown, [prettier doesn't support language-specific settings inside Markdown files](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5378) so you'll need to format the code yourself for now.

4. Push your work back up to your fork on GitHub
5. Submit a Pull Request so that we can review your changes

## Config

Content is controlled by the config file `course-structure.json`. All content is in the `content` dir sorted by the slug in `course-structure.json`.

## Writing Content for this Guide

Use the terms at https://docs.solana.com/terminology

A **Track** is a provable skill. Right now the tracks are simply 'dApp development' and 'Onchain program development'.

A **Unit** is a group of lessons. 

Each **Lesson** is a block of added understanding, starting from scratch and building on the previous lesson to take students to mastery of a topic. 

Lessons should follow the format:

 - **Lesson** section is the main body of the lesson, explaining the new concepts. The equivalent would be when a teacher in a classroom says "don't do this yet, just watch.". This section is intentionally not meant to be something readers code along with.

 - **Lab** section is when students code along and should follow a step-by-step process.

## Static Assets

Static assets are in `assets`. This is set in `svelte.config.js` to match the older soldev-ui directory. 

To include an image:

```markdown
![Some alt text](../assets/somefile.svg)
```

## Components

Components are individual Svelte files, in the `/src/lib/components` directory.

Routes (pages) are in `/src/lib/routes`

## Development

```
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Localization

In order for the course structure to be maintained, localized files need to adhere to the following rules:

1. Localized lesson files should be in a subdirectory of `content` named after the language abbreviation. For example, lessons translated into Spanish should be housed in `content/es`.
2. Localized asset files should be in a subdirectory of `assets` named after the language abbreviation. For example, assets localized into Spanish should be housed in `assets/es`.
3. File names for localized files must be identical to their English counterpart. To be clear, _do not translate file names_. The file name is used as the slug for the article and must be identical between languages.
